This folder contains all the files related to Color Detection System Project.

This project is created as TKinter GUI.

When the mouse cursor hovers over the pixel on an image file, color is detected for that specific pixel. The name & RGB value of the detected color is displayed on the top of the window.

NOTE: Project Extension folder contains draft source code for Color Detection System on a video file. (Still Work In Progress)
